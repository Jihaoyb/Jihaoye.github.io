<i>Kali Linux</i>
  *  Conducted targeted network surveillance using airodump-ng to capture essential data packets for security analysis
  *  Applied cryptographic analysis techniques to decrypt WEP/WPA/WPA2 protocols, extracting initialization vectors and keys from the captured data, underscoring security vulnerabilities of the targeted networks
  *  Leveraged decryption keys to conduct a detailed analysis of client-router packet exchanges, extracting sensitive data such as user credentials and session tokens and understanding security vulnerabilities extending beyond network perimeters
